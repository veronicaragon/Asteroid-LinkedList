# Asteroid Linked List ☄️ 

Welcome to the Asteroid Linked List and Collatz Lab! This Java program explores the implementation of an asteroid linked list and demonstrates the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer.

## How to Use

1. **Print Linked List:**
   - Execute the `printLL` method to display the linked list.

2. **Calculate Average Mass:**
   - View the average mass of all elements in the linked list and array using the `getAverageMass` method and `computeAverageMass` helper function.

3. **Collatz Sequence:**
   - Experience the Collatz sequence using the `collatzSequence` method. The sequence should end in 4, 2, 1, regardless of the input number.
